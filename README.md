## .Quote of the Day.

```html
"You weren't born just to live a life and to die; you were born to accomplish something specifically. Matter of fact, success is making it to the end of your purpose; that is success... Success is not just existing. Success is making it to the end of why you were born."
<!-- Myles Munroe -->
